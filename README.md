# Dataanalysis-SQL
SQL Data Analysis project for Project Rockbuster

Introduction

Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a traditional movie rental company facing stiff competition from streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime. To adapt, the company plans to launch an online video rental service. As a data analyst in the business intelligence (BI) department, my role is to support the launch strategy by analyzing Rockbusterâ€™s historical data to answer key business questions. This includes understanding the customer base, identifying revenue drivers, and assessing geographical trends.

Key Objectives

The Rockbuster management board has posed several strategic questions, such as:

Which movies generate the most or least revenue?
What is the average rental duration for movies?
In which countries are our customers located?
Where are customers with high lifetime value based?
Do sales figures vary significantly by region?
To address these questions, I used SQL to load, clean, and analyze data within a relational database management system (RDBMS). The findings will be compiled into a comprehensive report for the management board to inform their 2020 strategy.

Aiming to provide deliverables answering the above objectives
